# Dark-Themed Mobile Texting Application

Application inspired by WhatsApp and Telegram used for texting one with a dark theme touch

## Description

Overview

This mobile app is an IOS/Android cross-platform application built in the React Native framework and Node.JS as a runtime environment. The use of MongoDB for messages being received/sent is also put into place. AWS Amplify is also being used for many features such as email verification codes and authentication. Currently, this project only has a functional UI and navigation. I plan to add backend functionality along with MongoDB database management soon.

Signup/Signin

The user is to input email information for verification and then proceed to make a password. With the user created in the system, the app can be accessed and used for messaging.
